# Stripe Payment Link System with Automatic User Updates

## Overview

This system enables **automatic Firebase user updates** when customers pay through the Stripe payment link: `https://buy.stripe.com/9B600leAr0Mreueg7b8EM03`

## How It Works

### 1. Pre-Payment Setup
When a user clicks "Subscribe":
- User's Firebase UID and email are stored in `sessionStorage`
- User is redirected to the Stripe payment link
- Session info expires after 1 hour for security

### 2. Payment Processing
- Customer completes payment on Stripe
- Stripe webhook receives payment notification
- System attempts to match payment by customer email
- Firebase user is automatically updated with full access

### 3. Post-Payment Verification
- User returns to success page
- System verifies payment and grants access
- User gets immediate premium access

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **`src/components/SubscriptionPlans.js`** & **`SubscriptionPlansModal.js`**
   - Store user info in sessionStorage before payment
   - Redirect to Stripe payment link

2. **`api/webhooks/stripe.js`**
   - Match payments by customer email
   - Update Firebase users automatically
   - Handle both payment links and programmatic checkouts

3. **`api/match-payment-by-email.js`**
   - Manual API to match payments by email
   - Fallback for payment verification

4. **`src/components/SuccessPage.js`**
   - Verify payment completion
   - Trigger user update if needed
   - Provide user feedback

## User Access Granted

When payment is successful, users get:

```javascript
subscription: {
  status: 'active',
  plan: 'tier1',
  fullAccess: true,           // üîë Key for paywall access
  paymentType: 'stripe_link',
  activatedAt: '2025-01-15T...',
  updatedAt: '2025-01-15T...',
  activatedByEmail: true
}
```

## Payment Flow

```
1. User logged in ‚Üí clicks "Subscribe"
2. sessionStorage stores: { userId, userEmail, planType, timestamp }
3. Redirect to: https://buy.stripe.com/9B600leAr0Mreueg7b8EM03
4. Customer completes payment with their email
5. Stripe webhook ‚Üí match by email ‚Üí update Firebase user
6. User returns to success page ‚Üí verification ‚Üí access granted
```

## Automatic Matching Logic

### Webhook Process:
1. **Stripe sends payment notification**
2. **Extract customer email** from Stripe data
3. **Search Firebase** for user with matching email
4. **Update subscription** with full access
5. **Log success** or store unmatched payment

### Fallback Verification:
1. **Success page checks** sessionStorage
2. **Calls API** to match payment by email
3. **Grants access** if payment found
4. **Shows confirmation** to user

## Error Handling

### User Not Found:
- Payment stored in `unmatchedPayments` collection
- Can be manually processed later via admin panel

### Email Mismatch:
- User sees warning message
- Directed to contact support
- Manual verification available

### Session Expired:
- Generic success message shown
- 5-minute grace period mentioned
- Support contact provided

## Admin Features

- **View all payments** in Stripe Dashboard
- **Manual user activation** via `/admin/access`
- **Unmatched payments** tracking
- **Email-based user search**

## Security Features

- **Session timeout** (1 hour)
- **Email verification** before access
- **Timestamp validation**
- **User authentication** required

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (backend)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (webhook verification)

# Firebase Configuration (for webhook)
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...

```

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Payment Flow:
```bash
1. Login to your app
2. Click "Subscribe" button
3. Complete payment on Stripe
4. Return to success page
5. Verify premium access
```

### 2. Verify Firebase Update:

2. Go to users/{userId}
3. Verify subscription.fullAccess = true
4. Verify subscription.status = 'active'
```

### 3. Test Paywall:
```bash
1. Try accessing premium features
2. Verify no paywall blocks appear
3. Confirm unlimited access
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks:
- Monitor Stripe Dashboard for new payments
- Check Vercel function logs for errors
- Verify webhook events are processing

### Weekly Reviews:
- Check `unmatchedPayments` collection
- Process any manual activations needed
- Review success page analytics

## Support Workflow

3. **Check subscription status** in their user document
4. **Use admin panel** to manually grant access if needed
5. **Verify they see premium features**
