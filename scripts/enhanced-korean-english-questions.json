    "questionText": "(A)\n\"Do you remember when Sean used to tell me that I was the best dad in the world?\" Ethan asked his wife, Grace. \"Yes, I do. I always envied your relationship with Sean,\" she replied. Ethan then shared how things had changed since (a) his son started middle school. Grace had noticed Ethan often pushing Sean to study harder. \"Maybe he isn't that into school right now. How about going hiking, just the two of you?\" she suggested. He agreed, and realizing that both his and Sean's hiking jackets were still at the laundry, he asked his wife to go and pick them up with him.\n\n(B)\nEthan and Grace came back home with the jackets and checked if Sean had everything else he needed for hiking. Luckily, in his drawers they found his hat, shoes, sunglasses, and hiking sticks. When Sean returned from school, Ethan softly said, \"Sean, let's go hiking this Saturday, just the two of us.\" Though Sean thanked (b) him for the suggestion, he said he had to go to the library. Grace stepped in, \"You know, the weather this weekend will be the best of the year. Why not enjoy it?\" After a moment's hesitation, (c) he agreed.\n\n(C)\n\"When did you bring the jackets in?\" the clerk at the laundry asked. \"Maybe two weeks ago,\" Ethan replied. Then, Grace quickly reminded (d) him, \"Honey, we actually left them here a month ago.\" The clerk went into the storage area to look for the clothes. Finally, he returned with the jackets and handed them to Ethan. The clerk politely said, \"I am sorry, but please collect your items earlier next time. Our storage is too full.\" Ethan felt embarrassed for the late collection and apologized.\n\n(D)\nThe weather was perfect. Ethan and Sean set off hiking along the valley by Aicken Mountain. They walked in silence until Sean fell over a rock and twisted his ankle. Realizing he couldn't walk, Ethan carried his son down on his back. He felt Sean's heartbeat, something he hadn't felt since Sean was a baby. Suddenly, Sean said, \"Dad, I'm sorry. At some point, I started to become afraid of disappointing (e) you. But you are still the best dad.\" Energized, he felt no weight on his back and replied, \"You are the best son, no matter what.\"",

I always envied your relationship with Sean,\" she replied. Ethan then shared how things had changed since (a) his son started middle school. Grace had noticed Ethan often pushing Sean to study harder. \"Maybe he isn't that into school right now. How about going hiking, just the two of you?\" she suggested. He agreed, and realizing that both his and Sean's hiking jackets were still at the laundry, he asked his wife to go and pick them up with him.\n\n(B)\nEthan and Grace came back home with the jackets and checked if Sean had everything else he needed for hiking. Luckily, in his drawers they found his hat, shoes, sunglasses, and hiking sticks. When Sean returned from school, Ethan softly said, \"Sean, let's go hiking this Saturday, just the two of us.\" Though Sean thanked (b) him for the suggestion, he said he had to go to the library. Grace stepped in, \"You know, the weather this weekend will be the best of the year. Why not enjoy it?\" After a moment's hesitation, (c) he agreed.\n\n(C)\n\"When did you bring the jackets in?\" the clerk at the laundry asked. \"Maybe two weeks ago,\" Ethan replied. Then, Grace quickly reminded (d) him, \"Honey, we actually left them here a month ago.\" The clerk went into the storage area to look for the clothes. Finally, he returned with the jackets and handed them to Ethan. The clerk politely said, \"I am sorry, but please collect your items earlier next time. Our storage is too full.\" Ethan felt embarrassed for the late collection and apologized.\n\n(D)\nThe weather was perfect. Ethan and Sean set off hiking along the valley by Aicken Mountain. They walked in silence until Sean fell over a rock and twisted his ankle. Realizing he couldn't walk, Ethan carried his son down on his back. He felt Sean's heartbeat, something he hadn't felt since Sean was a baby. Suddenly, Sean said, \"Dad, I'm sorry. At some point, I started to become afraid of disappointing (e) you. But you are still the best dad.\" Energized, he felt no weight on his back and replied, \"You are the best son, no matter what.\"",

Typically, synthetic ingredients can be made in a precisely controlled fashion and have well-defined compositions and properties, allowing careful evaluation of their potential toxicity. On the other hand, natural ingredients often vary appreciably in their composition and properties depending on their origin, the time of year they were harvested, the climate they experienced throughout their lifetime, the soil quality, and how they were isolated and stored. These variations can make testing their safety extremely difficult ― one is never sure about the potential toxicity of minor components that may vary from time to time. In some cases, a natural food component has been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years without causing any obvious health problems and can, therefore, be assumed to be safe.

Just as the railways revolutionized travel in the nineteenth century, so the automobile produced even more dramatic changes in the twentieth. ① The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically. ② Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain. ③ Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment. ④ The expansion of reasonably priced, good quality accommodation associated with tourism growth has also facilitated the growth of locally based restaurants. ⑤ As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.",

Core language teaching materials must concentrate on how a language operates both as a rule-based system and as a sociosemantic system. Very often, the process of learning is essentially analytic, piecemeal, and, at the level of the personality, fairly superficial. Engaging imaginatively with literature enables learners to shift the focus of their attention beyond the more mechanical aspects of the foreign language system.

The self-portrait showed to others the status of the person depicted. In this sense, what we have come to call our own \"image\" ― the interface of the way we think we look and the way others see us ― is the first and fundamental object of global visual culture. The selfie depicts the drama of our own daily performance of ourselves in tension with our inner emotions that may or may not be expressed as we wish. At each stage of the self-portrait's expansion, more and more people have been able to depict themselves. Today's young, urban, networked majority has reworked the history of the self-portrait to make the selfie into the first visual signature of the new era.",

Factories could produce around the clock, and they could do so with greater speed and volume than ever before. A machine that runs twelve hours a day will produce more widgets than one that runs for only eight hours per day ― and a machine that runs twenty-four hours per day will produce the most widgets of all. As such, at many factories, the workday is divided into eight-hour shifts, so that there will always be people on hand to keep the widget machines humming. Industrialization raised the potential value of every single work hour ― the more hours you worked, the more widgets you produced, and the more money you made ― and thus wages became tied to effort and production.

        "value": "(A) Emma and Clara stood side by side on the beach road, with their eyes fixed on the boundless ocean. The breathtaking scene that surrounded them was beyond description. Just after sunrise, they finished their preparations for the bicycle ride along the beach road. Emma turned to Clara with a question, \"Do you think this will be your favorite ride ever?\" Clara's face lit up with a bright smile as she nodded. \"Definitely! (a) I can't wait to ride while watching those beautiful waves!\"\n(B) When they reached their destination, Emma and Clara stopped their bikes. Emma approached Clara, saying \"Bicycle riding is unlike swimming, isn't it?\" Clara answered with a smile, \"Quite similar, actually. Just like swimming, riding makes me feel truly alive.\" She added, \"It shows (b) me what it means to live while facing life's tough challenges.\" Emma nodded in agreement and suggested, \"Your first beach bike ride was a great success. How about coming back next summer?\" Clara replied with delight, \"With (c) you, absolutely!\"\n(C) Clara used to be a talented swimmer, but she had to give up her dream of becoming an Olympic medalist in swimming because of shoulder injuries. Yet she responded to the hardship in a constructive way. After years of hard training, she made an incredible recovery and found a new passion for bike riding. Emma saw how the painful past made her maturer and how it made (d) her stronger in the end. One hour later, Clara, riding ahead of Emma, turned back and shouted, \"Look at the white cliff!\"\n(D) Emma and Clara jumped on their bikes and started to pedal toward the white cliff where the beach road ended. Speeding up and enjoying the wide blue sea, Emma couldn't hide her excitement and exclaimed, \"Clara, the view is amazing!\" Clara's silence, however, seemed to say that she was lost in her thoughts. Emma understood the meaning of her silence. Watching Clara riding beside her, Emma thought about Clara's past tragedy, which (e) she now seemed to have overcome.",

    "questionText": "A musical score within any film can add an additional layer to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound designers, composers often shy away from creating unique pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of space and time, it in fact ____________________. Through recognizable scores, visions of the future or a galaxy far, far away can be placed within a recognizable context. Such familiarity allows the viewer to be placed in a comfortable space so that the film may then lead the viewer to what is an unfamiliar, but acceptable vision of a world different from their own.",

He earned his doctoral degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1939, and then he took a job at Bell Labs in New York City. After World War II, he became an associate professor of physics at Columbia University. In 1958, Townes and his co-researcher proposed the concept of the laser. Laser technology won quick acceptance in industry and research. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964. He was also involved in Project Apollo, the moon landing project.

    "questionText": "Managers of natural resources typically face market incentives that provide financial rewards for exploitation. For example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But the economic benefits provided by these services, based on their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct \"signal\" to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses.",

Camila relaxed only when Hailey had safely placed the cake on the party table. \"Dad will be here shortly. What gift did (a) you buy for his birthday?\" Camila asked out of interest. \"Dad will be surprised to find out what it is!\" Hailey answered with a wink.\n\n(B)\n\"Dad, these glasses can help correct your red-green color blindness,\" said Hailey. He slowly put them on, and stared at the birthday presents on the table. Seeing vivid red and green colors for the first time ever, he started to cry. \"Incredible! Look at those wonderful colors!\" He shouted in amazement. Hailey told him in tears, \"Dad, I'm glad you can now finally enjoy the true beauty of rainbows and roses. Red represents love and green represents health. You deserve both.\" Camila nodded, seeing how happy (b) her gift of the glasses had made their dad.\n\n(C)\n\"Happy birthday! You're fifty today, Dad. We love you!\" Camila said before (c) her sister handed him a small parcel. When he opened it, he discovered a pair of glasses inside. \"Hailey, Dad doesn't have eyesight problems,\" Camila said, puzzled. \"Actually Camila, I recently found out he has long been suffering from color blindness. He's kept it a secret so as not to worry us,\" Hailey explained.\n\n(D)\n\"I bet (d) you bought a wallet or a watch for him,\" Camila said. In reply, Hailey answered, \"No. I bought something much more personal. By the way, there's something (e) you should know about Dad...\" They were suddenly interrupted by the doorbell ringing. It was their dad and they were overjoyed to see him. \"My lovely ladies, thank you for inviting me to your place for my birthday.\" He walked in joyfully, hugging his daughters. They all walked into the dining room, where he was greeted with a rainbow-colored birthday cake and fifty red roses.",

For example, algorithms have proved more (a) accurate than humans in predicting whether a prisoner released on parole will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In over 100 studies across many different domains, half of all cases show simple formulas make (b) better significant predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very uncertain, simple formulas can win out by focusing on the most important factors and being consistent, while human judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and perhaps (c) irrelevant considerations. A similar idea is supported by further evidence that 'checklists' can improve the quality of expert decisions in a range of domains by ensuring that important steps or considerations aren't missed when people are feeling (d) relaxed. For example, treating patients in intensive care can require hundreds of small actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using checklists to ensure that no crucial steps are missed has proved to be remarkably (e) effective in a range of medical contexts, from preventing live infections to reducing pneumonia.",

    "questionText": "Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ― their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about nature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody. ( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from streets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What's behind this idea is not only landscape architects' desire to design aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces and oppositional forces.\n\nThere's a reason for that: traditionally, park designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing other means of partition.",

        "value": "Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ― their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about nature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody. ( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from streets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What's behind this idea is not only landscape architects' desire to design aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces and oppositional forces.\n\nThere's a reason for that: traditionally, park designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing other means of partition.",

To understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion's importance as a basis for change.

Clothes are part of how people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates them in the present, relative to what is happening in society and to fashion's own history. As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the meanings ③ associated with specific pieces of clothing. Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of self-expression: clothes can be ④ inexpensively purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if none of these is true.

    "questionText": "Different parts of the brain's visual system get information on a need-to-know basis. Cells that help your hand muscles reach out to an object need to know the size and location of the object, but they don't need to know about color. They need to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that help you recognize people's faces need to be extremely sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object sees everything about it ― the shape, color, location, and movement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape, another sees color, another detects location, and another perceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain damage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine how someone could see an object without seeing what color it is. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it without seeing whether it is moving.",

Diaries were central media through which enlightened and free subjects could be constructed. They provided a space where one could write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It is in that context that the idea of \"the self [as] both made and explored with words\" emerges. Diaries were personal and private; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas's formulation, one would make oneself public to oneself.

Anna, the head of the club, was teaching the new members basic moves. Close by, her friend Jane was assisting Anna. Jane noticed that Anna was glancing at the entrance door of the gym. She seemed to be expecting someone. At last, when Anna took a break, Jane came over to (a) her and asked, \"Hey, are you waiting for Cora?\"\n\n(B) Cora walked in like a wounded soldier with bandages on her face and arms. Surprised, Anna and Jane simply looked at her with their eyes wide open. Cora explained, \"I'm sorry I've been absent. I got into a bicycle accident, and I was in the hospital for two days. Finally, the doctor gave me the okay to practice.\" Anna said excitedly, \"No problem! We're thrilled to have you back!\" Then, Jane gave Anna an apologetic look, and (b) she responded with a friendly pat on Jane's shoulder.\n\n(C) Anna answered the question by nodding uneasily. In fact, Jane knew what her friend was thinking. Cora was a new member, whom Anna had personally invited to join the club. Anna really liked (c) her. Although her budget was tight, Anna bought Cora a taekwondo uniform. When she received it, Cora thanked her and promised, \"I'll come to practice and work hard every day.\" However, unexpectedly, she came to practice only once and then never showed up again.\n\n(D) Since Cora had missed several practices, Anna wondered what could have happened. Jane, on the other hand, was disappointed and said judgingly, \"Still waiting for her, huh? I can't believe (d) you don't feel disappointed or angry. Why don't you forget about her?\" Anna replied, \"Well, I know most newcomers don't keep their commitment to the club, but I thought that Cora would be different.

At last, when Anna took a break, Jane came over to (a) her and asked, \"Hey, are you waiting for Cora?\"\n\n(B) Cora walked in like a wounded soldier with bandages on her face and arms. Surprised, Anna and Jane simply looked at her with their eyes wide open. Cora explained, \"I'm sorry I've been absent. I got into a bicycle accident, and I was in the hospital for two days. Finally, the doctor gave me the okay to practice.\" Anna said excitedly, \"No problem! We're thrilled to have you back!\" Then, Jane gave Anna an apologetic look, and (b) she responded with a friendly pat on Jane's shoulder.\n\n(C) Anna answered the question by nodding uneasily. In fact, Jane knew what her friend was thinking. Cora was a new member, whom Anna had personally invited to join the club. Anna really liked (c) her. Although her budget was tight, Anna bought Cora a taekwondo uniform. When she received it, Cora thanked her and promised, \"I'll come to practice and work hard every day.\" However, unexpectedly, she came to practice only once and then never showed up again.\n\n(D) Since Cora had missed several practices, Anna wondered what could have happened. Jane, on the other hand, was disappointed and said judgingly, \"Still waiting for her, huh? I can't believe (d) you don't feel disappointed or angry. Why don't you forget about her?\" Anna replied, \"Well, I know most newcomers don't keep their commitment to the club, but I thought that Cora would be different.

It is the responsibility of management to prevent or, at least, to ease these fears. For example, robots could be introduced only in new plants rather than replacing humans in existing assembly lines. Workers should be included in the planning for new factories or the introduction of robots into existing plants, so they can participate in the process. It may be that robots are needed to reduce manufacturing costs so that the company remains competitive, but planning for such cost reductions should be done jointly by labor and management. Since robots are particularly good at highly repetitive simple motions, the replaced human workers should be moved to positions where judgment and decisions beyond the abilities of robots are required.\n\nRetraining current employees for new positions within the company will also greatly reduce their fear of being laid off.",

The use of a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems by employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions, experimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even some of the same theoretical statements. Scientists need only understand how to use these various elements in ways that others would accept. These elements of shared practice thus need not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists' beliefs about what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role of a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully without having to provide a detailed account of what they are doing or what they believe about it.

Today too, because of the heavy snow, Mom was doing her office work at the kitchen table. Felix, the high schooler, had to take online classes in his room. Five-year-old Sean, who normally went to kindergarten, was sneaking around in the house playing home policeman. (a) The kindergartener wanted to know what his family members were up to, and was checking up on everyone.\n\n(B)\n\"All right. I'm sure you're doing your work.\" Mom replied, and then sharply added a question. \"Sean, what are you doing?\" Sean's face immediately became blank, and he said, \"Nothing.\" \"Come here, Honey, and you can help me.\" Sean ran to the kitchen right away. \"What can I do for you, Mom?\" His voice was high, and Felix could sense that his brother was excited. Felix was pleased to get rid of (b) the policeman, and now he could concentrate on the lesson, at least till Sean came back.\n\n(C)\nWhile checking on his family, Sean interfered in their business as if it was his own. This time, (c) the playful and curious boy was interested in his brother Felix, who committed himself to studying no matter where he was. Sean secretly looked inside his brother's room from the door, and shouted toward the kitchen where Mom was working, \"Mom, Felix isn't studying. He's just watching a funny video.\" Sean was naughtily smiling at his brother.\n\n(D)\nFelix was mad because (d) his little brother was bothering him. Felix was studying science using a video posted on the school web site. He made an angry face at the naughty boy. Right then, Mom asked loudly from the kitchen, \"What are you doing, Felix?\" Felix's room was located next to the kitchen, and he could hear Mom clearly. \"I'm watching a lecture video for my science class.\" Felix argued against Sean's accusation and mischievously stuck (e) his tongue out at his little brother.",

Today too, because of the heavy snow, Mom was doing her office work at the kitchen table. Felix, the high schooler, had to take online classes in his room. Five-year-old Sean, who normally went to kindergarten, was sneaking around in the house playing home policeman. (a) The kindergartener wanted to know what his family members were up to, and was checking up on everyone.\n\n(B)\n\"All right. I'm sure you're doing your work.\" Mom replied, and then sharply added a question. \"Sean, what are you doing?\" Sean's face immediately became blank, and he said, \"Nothing.\" \"Come here, Honey, and you can help me.\" Sean ran to the kitchen right away. \"What can I do for you, Mom?\" His voice was high, and Felix could sense that his brother was excited. Felix was pleased to get rid of (b) the policeman, and now he could concentrate on the lesson, at least till Sean came back.\n\n(C)\nWhile checking on his family, Sean interfered in their business as if it was his own. This time, (c) the playful and curious boy was interested in his brother Felix, who committed himself to studying no matter where he was. Sean secretly looked inside his brother's room from the door, and shouted toward the kitchen where Mom was working, \"Mom, Felix isn't studying. He's just watching a funny video.\" Sean was naughtily smiling at his brother.\n\n(D)\nFelix was mad because (d) his little brother was bothering him. Felix was studying science using a video posted on the school web site. He made an angry face at the naughty boy. Right then, Mom asked loudly from the kitchen, \"What are you doing, Felix?\" Felix's room was located next to the kitchen, and he could hear Mom clearly. \"I'm watching a lecture video for my science class.\" Felix argued against Sean's accusation and mischievously stuck (e) his tongue out at his little brother.",

Rather, it means that the complexity of the animal's behavior is not purely a (a) product of its internal complexity. Herbert Simon's \"parable of the ant\" makes this point very clearly. Imagine an ant walking along a beach, and (b) visualize tracking the trajectory of the ant as it moves. The trajectory would show a lot of twists and turns, and would be very irregular and complicated. One could then suppose that the ant had equally complicated (c) internal navigational abilities, and work out what these were likely to be by analyzing the trajectory to infer the rules and mechanisms that could produce such a complex navigational path. The complexity of the trajectory, however, \"is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant.\" In reality, the ant may be using a set of very (d) complex rules: it is the interaction of these rules with the environment that actually produces the complex trajectory, not the ant alone.

The conception of political power as a coercive force, while it may be a Western fixation, is not a universal. It is very unusual for an Amazonian leader to give an order. If many peoples do not view political power as a coercive force, nor as the most valued domain, then the leap from 'the political' to 'domination' (as coercion), and from there to 'domination of women', is a shaky one.

( ① ) However, you might not get a more detailed sense of the particular sorts of way in which Maddy is bad, her typical character traits, and the like, since people can be bad in many ways. ( ② ) In contrast, if I say that Maddy is wicked, then you get more of a sense of her typical actions and attitudes to others. ( ③ ) The word 'wicked' is more specific than 'bad'. ( ④ ) But there is more detail nevertheless, perhaps a stronger connotation of the sort of person Maddy is. ( ⑤ ) In addition, and again assuming typical linguistic conventions, you should also get a sense that I am disapproving of Maddy, or saying that you should disapprove of her, or similar, assuming that we are still discussing her moral character.",

Ask a friend to cup his hand, palm face up, and close his eyes. Place a small ordinary object in his palm ― a ring, an eraser, anything will do ― and ask him to identify it without moving any part of his hand. He won't have a clue other than weight and maybe overall size. Then tell him to keep his eyes closed and move his fingers over the object. He'll most likely identify it at once. By allowing the fingers to move, you've added time to the sensory perception of touch. There's a direct analogy between the fovea at the center of your retina and your fingertips, both of which have high acuity.

We require people to do repeated operations with the extreme precision and accuracy required by machines, again something we are not good at.

We can become experts in some areas, like speaking a language or knowing our favorite foods, simply by living our lives, but in many other domains expertise requires considerable training and effort.

This was Nina's favorite season, but she remained silent for hours while Marie was driving. Nina had been heartbroken after losing her championship belt. Now a former champion, she was thinking of retiring from boxing. Marie, her long-time friend and trainer, shared her pain. After another silent hour, Marie and Nina saw a sign: Sauble Falls. Marie thought this would be a good place for (a) them to stop.\n\n(B)\nThen, with a great push, a small one turned a complete circle and made it over the falls. \"He made it!\" Nina shouted at the success with admiration. More salmon then followed and succeeded. She felt ashamed to be looking at (b) them. After a moment, she turned to Marie and said, \"Giving up is not in my vocabulary. Marie, I'll get my championship belt back.\" Marie nodded with a bright smile. \"Our training begins tomorrow. It's going to be tough. Are you ready?\" Walking up the path and back to the car, (c) they could still hear the fish splashing in the water.\n\n(C)\nMarie pulled over into the parking lot. Marie and Nina went down a path to watch the falls. Another sign: Watch Your Step. Rocks Are Slippery. (d) They found the falls spilling out in various layers of rock. No one was there except them. \"Look at them!\" Marie pointed to movement in the water moving toward the falls. Hundreds of fish tails were flashing and catching light from the sun, moving upstream. Beneath them in the water, they saw salmon slowly moving their bodies.\n\n(D)\nWhile Marie and Nina kept watching the salmon, a big one suddenly leapt. It threw itself up and over the rushing water above, but in vain. (e) They were standing without a word and watching the fish struggling. Another jumped, its body spinning until it made it over the falls. Another one leapt and was washed back by the power of the water. Watching the salmon, Marie noticed Nina fixing her eyes on their continuing challenge. Nina's heart was beating fast at each leap and twist.",

And the species has evolved elaborate greeting behaviors, the form of which reflects the strength of the social bond between the individuals (much like how you might merely shake hands with a long-standing acquaintance but hug a close friend you have not seen in a while, and maybe even tear up). Elephants may greet each other simply by reaching their trunks into each other's mouths, possibly equivalent to a human peck on the cheek. However, after long absences, members of family and bond groups greet one another with incredibly theatrical displays. The fact that the intensity reflects the duration of the separation as well as the level of intimacy suggests that elephants have a sense of time as well. To human eyes, these greetings strike a familiar chord. I'm reminded of the joyous reunions so visible in the arrivals area of an international airport terminal.",

    "questionText": "There have been many attempts to define what music is in terms of the specific attributes of musical sounds. The famous nineteenth-century critic Eduard Hanslick regarded 'the measurable tone' as 'the primary and essential condition of all music'. Musical sounds, he was saying, can be distinguished from those of nature by the fact that they involve the use of fixed pitches, whereas virtually all natural sounds consist of constantly fluctuating frequencies. And a number of twentieth-century writers have assumed, like Hanslick, that fixed pitches are among the defining features of music. Now it is true that in most of the world's musical cultures, pitches are _______________________________. However, this is a generalization about music and not a definition of it, for it is easy to put forward counter-examples. Japanese shakuhachi music and the sanjo music of Korea, for instance, fluctuate constantly around the notional pitches in terms of which the music is organized.",

The loss of biodiversity has generated concern over the consequences for ecosystem functioning and thus understanding the relationship between both has become a major focus in ecological research during the last two decades. The \"biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis\" by Elton suggests that high diversity increases the competitive environment of communities and makes them more difficult to invade. Numerous biodiversity experiments have been conducted since Elton's time and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the often observed negative relationship between diversity and invasibility. Beside the decreased chance of empty ecological niches but the increased probability of competitors that prevent invasion success, diverse communities are assumed to use resources more completely and, therefore, limit the ability of invaders to establish. Further, more diverse communities are believed to be more stable because they use a broader range of niches than species-poor communities.",

This might seem surprising, for the early cotton masters wanted to keep their machinery running as long as possible and forced their employees to work very long hours.

'Leisure' as a distinct non-work time, whether in the form of the holiday, weekend, or evening, was a result of the disciplined and bounded work time created by capitalist production. Workers then wanted more leisure and leisure time was enlarged by union campaigns, which first started in the cotton industry, and eventually new laws were passed that (c) limited the hours of work and gave workers holiday entitlements.\nLeisure was also the creation of capitalism in another sense, through the commercialization of leisure.

One is to create an image of sunlight and shadow so that wrinkles of the topography are alternately lit and shaded, creating a visual representation of the shape of the land. ( ① ) Another, technically more accurate way is to draw contour lines. ( ② ) A contour line connects all points that lie at the same elevation.

As a result, a reliance on schemata will inevitably make the world seem more \"normal\" than it really is and will make the past seem more \"regular\" than it actually was.\n(B) Any reliance on schematic knowledge, therefore, will be shaped by this information about what's \"normal.\" Thus, if there are things you don't notice while viewing a situation or event, your schemata will lead you to fill in these \"gaps\" with knowledge about what's normally in place in that setting. \n(C) But schematic knowledge can also hurt you, promoting errors in perception and memory. Moreover, the types of errors produced by schemata are quite predictable: Bear in mind that schemata summarize the broad pattern of your experience, and so they tell you, in essence, what's typical or ordinary in a given situation.",

As a result, a reliance on schemata will inevitably make the world seem more \"normal\" than it really is and will make the past seem more \"regular\" than it actually was.\n(B) Any reliance on schematic knowledge, therefore, will be shaped by this information about what's \"normal.\" Thus, if there are things you don't notice while viewing a situation or event, your schemata will lead you to fill in these \"gaps\" with knowledge about what's normally in place in that setting. \n(C) But schematic knowledge can also hurt you, promoting errors in perception and memory. Moreover, the types of errors produced by schemata are quite predictable: Bear in mind that schemata summarize the broad pattern of your experience, and so they tell you, in essence, what's typical or ordinary in a given situation.",

    "questionText": "The human species is unique in its ability to expand its functionality by inventing new cultural tools. Writing, arithmetic, science ― all are recent inventions. Our brains did not have enough time to evolve for them, but I reason that they were made possible because ________. When we learn to read, we recycle a specific region of our visual system known as the visual word-form area, enabling us to recognize strings of letters and connect them to language areas. Likewise, when we learn Arabic numerals we build a circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities ― a fast connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity area. Even an invention as elementary as finger-counting changes our cognitive abilities dramatically. Amazonian people who have not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as simple as, say, 6—2. This \"cultural recycling\" implies that the functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex mixture of biological and cultural constraints.",

The data revealed that the news of the king's death had been widely socially shared. By talking about the event, people gradually constructed a social narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event. At the same time, they consolidated their own memory of the personal circumstances in which the event took place, an effect known as \"flashbulb memory.\" The more an event is socially shared, the more it will be fixed in people's minds. Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural tendency people may have. Naturally, people should be driven to \"forget\" undesirable events. Thus, someone who just heard a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened. The ________ social sharing of the bad news contributes to realism.",

At some point, a Stone Age genius realized the enormous hunting advantage he would gain by being able to glide over the water's surface, and built the first boat.

The reason for this is not the external size and massiveness of their works, although the Egyptians admittedly achieved some amazing things in this respect. Many modern structures exceed those of Egypt in terms of purely physical size. But massiveness has nothing to do with monumentality. An Egyptian sculpture no bigger than a person's hand is more monumental than that gigantic pile of stones that constitutes the war memorial in Leipzig, for instance. Monumentality is not a matter of external weight, but of \"inner weight.\" This inner weight is the quality which Egyptian art possesses to such a degree that everything in it seems to be made of primeval stone, like a mountain range, even if it is only a few inches across or carved in wood.",

Many people do not understand large numbers. Indeed, large numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect (feeling).

Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries. Increasing aid for the world's poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD ― destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.",

Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries. Increasing aid for the world's poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD ― destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.",

They rode their bicycles to school together that morning, as they usually did. Dave had math on the first floor, and Steve was on the second with history. On his way to the classroom, Steve's teacher came up to him to ask if (a) he wanted to run for student president. Steve thought for a moment and answered, \"Sure, it'll be a great experience.\"\n\n(B)\nSteve won the election. Upon hearing the result, Dave went over to Steve and congratulated (b) him, shaking his hand. Steve could still see the disappointment burning in his eyes. It wasn't until later that evening, on the way home, that Dave said apologetically, \"I'm so sorry, Steve! This election hasn't damaged our friendship, has it?\" \"Of course not, Dave. We're friends as always!\" Steve responded with a smile. As Steve arrived home, his dad was proudly waiting for him and said, \"Congratulations on the win! How did Dave take it?\" Steve replied, \"We're fine now, best friends for life!\" (c) His dad laughed, \"Sounds like you won two battles today!\"\n\n(C)\nAfter class, Steve spotted Dave in the hallway and ran to him excitedly, \"I've got good news! I'm going for student president and I think mine will be the only nomination.\" Dave cleared his throat and replied with surprise, \"Actually, I've just registered my name, too!\" (d) He continued sharply, \"Well, best of luck! But don't think you'll win the election, Steve.\" Dave walked quickly away and from that moment on, there was an uncomfortable air of tension between the two friends. Steve tried to be friendly toward Dave, but he just didn't seem to care.\n\n(D)\nWhen the election day came, Steve found that his bicycle had a flat tire, so he started to run to school. Just as he reached the end of the street, Dave's dad, who was driving Dave to school, pulled over to give him a ride. The dead silence in the car made the drive painful. Noticing the bad atmosphere, Dave's dad said, \"You know, only one of you can win. You have known each other since birth. Don't let this election ruin your friendship. Try to be happy for each other!\" His words hit Dave hard. Looking at Steve, Dave felt the need to apologize to (e) him later that day.",

        "value": "(A)\nIt was the first day of the new semester. Steve and Dave were excited that they would be back at school again. They rode their bicycles to school together that morning, as they usually did. Dave had math on the first floor, and Steve was on the second with history. On his way to the classroom, Steve's teacher came up to him to ask if (a) he wanted to run for student president. Steve thought for a moment and answered, \"Sure, it'll be a great experience.\"\n\n(B)\nSteve won the election. Upon hearing the result, Dave went over to Steve and congratulated (b) him, shaking his hand. Steve could still see the disappointment burning in his eyes. It wasn't until later that evening, on the way home, that Dave said apologetically, \"I'm so sorry, Steve! This election hasn't damaged our friendship, has it?\" \"Of course not, Dave. We're friends as always!\" Steve responded with a smile. As Steve arrived home, his dad was proudly waiting for him and said, \"Congratulations on the win! How did Dave take it?\" Steve replied, \"We're fine now, best friends for life!\" (c) His dad laughed, \"Sounds like you won two battles today!\"\n\n(C)\nAfter class, Steve spotted Dave in the hallway and ran to him excitedly, \"I've got good news! I'm going for student president and I think mine will be the only nomination.\" Dave cleared his throat and replied with surprise, \"Actually, I've just registered my name, too!\" (d) He continued sharply, \"Well, best of luck! But don't think you'll win the election, Steve.\" Dave walked quickly away and from that moment on, there was an uncomfortable air of tension between the two friends. Steve tried to be friendly toward Dave, but he just didn't seem to care.\n\n(D)\nWhen the election day came, Steve found that his bicycle had a flat tire, so he started to run to school. Just as he reached the end of the street, Dave's dad, who was driving Dave to school, pulled over to give him a ride. The dead silence in the car made the drive painful. Noticing the bad atmosphere, Dave's dad said, \"You know, only one of you can win. You have known each other since birth. Don't let this election ruin your friendship. Try to be happy for each other!\" His words hit Dave hard. Looking at Steve, Dave felt the need to apologize to (e) him later that day.",

Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments. That scene in which your octogenarian feels humiliated will draw on your experience of humiliation in the eighth grade, even though the circumstances are totally different and you're not even consciously thinking about your middle-school years. Our characters' emotions, after all, draw on our own emotions. Sometimes, however, you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction, dramatizing actual incidents. Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield. Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself? The problem with this ─ and it is a very large problem ─ is that almost no one can view himself on the page. As the writer, you're too __________ to your own complicated makeup. It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you. In fact, that's what authors largely have done. You can still, of course, incorporate aspects of yourself: your love of Beethoven, your quick temper, your soccer injuries.

With regard to peer-to-peer risks such as bullying, this last element is of particular importance. This relates to a basic principle that children are taught in the offline world as well: 'do not do to others what you would not want others to do to you'. Children's SNS activities should be encouraged when we help them accumulate knowledge. This should also be a golden rule with regard to SNS, but for children and young people it is much more difficult to estimate the consequences and potential serious impact of their actions in this environment. Hence, raising awareness of children from a very early age about the particular characteristics of SNS and the potential long-term impact of a seemingly trivial act is crucial.",

One night he was watching a PBS-TV program about cartooning, when he decided to write to the host of the show, Jack Cassady, to ask for his advice about becoming a cartoonist. Much to his surprise, he heard back from Cassady within a few weeks in the form of a handwritten letter. The letter advised Adams not to be discouraged if he received early rejections. Adams got inspired and submitted some cartoons, but he was quickly rejected. Not following Cassady's advice, he became discouraged, put his materials away, and decided to forget cartooning as a career. About fifteen months later, he was surprised to receive yet another letter from Cassady, especially since he hadn't thanked him for his original advice. He acted again on Cassady's encouragement, but this time he stuck with it and obviously hit it big.",

    "questionText": "Some prominent journalists say that archaeologists should work with treasure hunters because treasure hunters have accumulated valuable historical artifacts that can reveal much about the past. But archaeologists are not asked to cooperate with tomb robbers, who also have valuable historical artifacts. The quest for profit and the search for knowledge cannot coexist in archaeology because of the time factor. Rather incredibly, one archaeologist employed by a treasure hunting firm said that as long as archaeologists are given six months to study shipwrecked artifacts before they are sold, no historical knowledge is found! On the contrary, archaeologists and assistants from the INA (Institute of Nautical Archaeology) needed more than a decade of year-round conservation before they could even catalog all the finds from an eleventh-century AD wreck they had excavated. Then, to interpret those finds, they had to learn Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian, without which they would never have learned the true nature of the site. Could a \"commercial archaeologist\" have waited more than a decade or so before selling the finds?",

The duration of copyright protection has increased steadily over the years; the life-plus-70-years standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which increased the 50-year limit established by the 1976 Copyright Act. Supporters of such legislation like to defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their impoverished descendants, but in reality the beneficiaries are more likely to be transnational publishing companies. And note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose. In addition to protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the publication of new creative works, copyright is also supposed to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts.

I look forward to hearing from you soon. \nBest regards, \nJoseph Loach",

    "questionText": "(A)\nA seventeen-year-old German boy named Erik Brandes stepped out onto the empty vast stage of the Cologne Opera House. It was the most exciting day of Erik's life. The youngest concert promoter in Germany had persuaded the Opera House to host a late-night concert of improvised jazz by the American pianist Keith Jarrett. The concert was a sellout, and later that evening, Keith would sit down at the piano and play.\n\n(B)\nWhen Keith began to play, everybody immediately knew this was magic. Erik too was deeply touched. Keith was unexpectedly producing the performance of a lifetime despite the shortcomings of the piano. His left hand produced thundering, repetitive bass riffs as a way of covering up the piano's lack of resonance. Keith really had to play that piano very hard to get enough volume to get to the balconies. Standing up and sitting down, Keith played the unplayable piano to produce something unique. It wasn't the music that he ever imagined playing. But faced with a challenge, he accepted it and flew high.\n\n(C)\nUnderstandably, Keith didn't want to perform. He left and went to wait in his car, leaving Erik to anticipate the arrival of soon-to-be furious concert-goers. Desperate, the German teenager caught up with Keith and begged the jazz pianist to play. The pianist looked out at him standing in the rain, completely soaked, and took pity on him. \"Never forget,\" Keith said. \"Only for you.\" A few hours later, Keith walked out to the unplayable piano in front of a packed concert hall.\n\n(D)\nBut when Erik introduced Keith and his producer Manfred to the piano on the stage that afternoon, it didn't go well. Keith and Manfred played a few notes. Then after a long silence, Manfred came to him and said, \"Erik, if you don't get another piano, Keith can't play tonight.\" Erik knew that Keith had requested a specific instrument, which the Opera House had agreed to provide. What he hadn't realized was that the administrative staff hadn't been able to find the requested Bösendorfer piano, and they had instead installed a tiny little Bösendorfer that was in poor condition.",

    "questionText": "(A)\nA seventeen-year-old German boy named Erik Brandes stepped out onto the empty vast stage of the Cologne Opera House. It was the most exciting day of Erik's life. The youngest concert promoter in Germany had persuaded the Opera House to host a late-night concert of improvised jazz by the American pianist Keith Jarrett. The concert was a sellout, and later that evening, Keith would sit down at the piano and play.\n\n(B)\nWhen Keith began to play, everybody immediately knew this was magic. Erik too was deeply touched. Keith was unexpectedly producing the performance of a lifetime despite the shortcomings of the piano. His left hand produced thundering, repetitive bass riffs as a way of covering up the piano's lack of resonance. Keith really had to play that piano very hard to get enough volume to get to the balconies. Standing up and sitting down, Keith played the unplayable piano to produce something unique. It wasn't the music that he ever imagined playing. But faced with a challenge, he accepted it and flew high.\n\n(C)\nUnderstandably, Keith didn't want to perform. He left and went to wait in his car, leaving Erik to anticipate the arrival of soon-to-be furious concert-goers. Desperate, the German teenager caught up with Keith and begged the jazz pianist to play. The pianist looked out at him standing in the rain, completely soaked, and took pity on him. \"Never forget,\" Keith said. \"Only for you.\" A few hours later, Keith walked out to the unplayable piano in front of a packed concert hall.\n\n(D)\nBut when Erik introduced Keith and his producer Manfred to the piano on the stage that afternoon, it didn't go well. Keith and Manfred played a few notes. Then after a long silence, Manfred came to him and said, \"Erik, if you don't get another piano, Keith can't play tonight.\" Erik knew that Keith had requested a specific instrument, which the Opera House had agreed to provide. What he hadn't realized was that the administrative staff hadn't been able to find the requested Bösendorfer piano, and they had instead installed a tiny little Bösendorfer that was in poor condition.",

    "questionText": "Duration refers to the time that events last. If we think of tempo as the speed of events, then duration is the speed of the clock itself. For the physicist, the duration of a \"second\" is precise and unambiguous: it is equal to 9,192,631,770 cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium-133. In the realm of psychological experience, however, quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation. When people are removed from the cues of \"real\" time ─ be it the sun, bodily fatigue, or timepieces themselves ─ it doesn't take long before their time sense breaks down. And it is this usually (A) psychological clock, as opposed to the time on one's watch, that creates the perception of duration that people experience. \nTheoretically, a person who mentally stretches the duration of time should experience a slower tempo. Imagine, for example, that baseballs are pitched to two different batters. The balls are thrown every 5 seconds for 50 seconds, so a total of 10 balls are thrown. We now ask both batters how much time has passed. Let's say that batter number one (who loves hitting) feels the duration to be 40 seconds. Batter number two (bored by baseball) believes it to be 60 seconds. Psychologically, then, the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds. The perceived tempo, in other words, is (B) for batter number one.",

Imagine, for example, that baseballs are pitched to two different batters. The balls are thrown every 5 seconds for 50 seconds, so a total of 10 balls are thrown. We now ask both batters how much time has passed. Let's say that batter number one (who loves hitting) feels the duration to be 40 seconds. Batter number two (bored by baseball) believes it to be 60 seconds. Psychologically, then, the first person has experienced baseballs approaching every four seconds while the second sees it as every six seconds. The perceived tempo, in other words, is (B) for batter number one.",

Residents commonly have positive views on the economic and some sociocultural influences of tourism on quality of life, but their reactions to environmental impacts are mixed. Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas, improves the quality of the roads and public facilities, and does not contribute to ecological decline. Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems, overcrowded outdoor recreation, or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks. Alternatively, some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing, hunting, and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion.

With Bob acting as interpreter, Paul offered 300 and his opponent proposed 450. The bargaining in the noisy market became spirited, even intense, with Paul stepping up his price slightly and the seller going down slowly. The pace increased so fast that Bob could not keep up with the back-and-forth interpretation. Meanwhile, observing the seller carefully, Paul sensed something wrong in Bob's interpretation. In fact, the seller had gone below Paul's last offer. When Paul raised his doubt, Bob instantly recognized the error and corrected his interpretation.

A pet's continuing affection becomes crucially important for those enduring hardship because it reassures them that their core essence has not been damaged. Thus pets are important in the treatment of depressed or chronically ill patients. In addition, pets are used to great advantage with the institutionalized aged. In such institutions it is difficult for the staff to retain optimism when all the patients are declining in health. Children who visit cannot help but remember what their parents or grandparents once were and be depressed by their incapacities. Animals, however, have no expectations about mental capacity. They do not worship youth. They have no memories about what the aged once was and greet them as if they were children. An old man holding a puppy can relive a childhood moment with complete accuracy.

Orphaned when his parents died during World War II, he was raised by his relatives. In the 1950s, Forman studied film at the film school of the University of Prague. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forman acted as either writer or assistant director on several films. Later, he emigrated to the U.S. and continued to make films. In 1975, he directed One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, which became only the second film in history to win Oscars in all the five major categories. Afterward, the movie Amadeus, a celebration of the genius of Mozart, which he also directed, swept eight Oscars including one for best director.

Although subjective interpretation goes into the construction of these cartographic elements, the finished map appears to express an authoritative truth about the world, separate from any interests and influences.

Congratulations, hugs, and laughter were contagious. Hannah looked at all the familiar faces that had been part of (a) her life for the last few years. Soon her mother would be joining them. She recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that same place, in the middle of many anxious freshmen, some of whom had become her closest friends. (B) \"Hannah, you look so serious. What are you thinking about?\" \"Oh, Mom, just, you know.\" Her mother smiled. \"You'll miss this place, won't you?\" Hannah nodded. \"Quick,\" her mother said, \"stand over there . . . and smile, Hannah. You have such a pretty smile.\" (b) She hurried out her cell phone, zoomed in on her daughter, and realized suddenly that she was looking at a young lady. \"You're all grown-up,\" she whispered. Hannah took more photos with her teachers in the school garden. She wished all the memories would remain in her mind forever. (C) Hannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless assignments, and the exams. However, there were exciting events like sports days and school festivals. How could (c) she ever forget her second year! She had sung and danced with her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance. After that, she had become more confident and active. Her thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mother's voice. \"Here you are!\" Her mother hurried over, and gave (d) her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug. (D) That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious were ahead. Hannah was nervous and trembling. The principal was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate. Later, a tall, strict-looking man introduced himself as (e) her homeroom teacher. The classroom was old, but neat and inviting. Hannah was seated in the fifth row, hallway side, even though she had wanted a window seat. High school life soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted.",

Congratulations, hugs, and laughter were contagious. Hannah looked at all the familiar faces that had been part of (a) her life for the last few years. Soon her mother would be joining them. She recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that same place, in the middle of many anxious freshmen, some of whom had become her closest friends. (B) \"Hannah, you look so serious. What are you thinking about?\" \"Oh, Mom, just, you know.\" Her mother smiled. \"You'll miss this place, won't you?\" Hannah nodded. \"Quick,\" her mother said, \"stand over there . . . and smile, Hannah. You have such a pretty smile.\" (b) She hurried out her cell phone, zoomed in on her daughter, and realized suddenly that she was looking at a young lady. \"You're all grown-up,\" she whispered. Hannah took more photos with her teachers in the school garden. She wished all the memories would remain in her mind forever. (C) Hannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless assignments, and the exams. However, there were exciting events like sports days and school festivals. How could (c) she ever forget her second year! She had sung and danced with her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance. After that, she had become more confident and active. Her thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mother's voice. \"Here you are!\" Her mother hurried over, and gave (d) her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug. (D) That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious were ahead. Hannah was nervous and trembling. The principal was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate. Later, a tall, strict-looking man introduced himself as (e) her homeroom teacher. The classroom was old, but neat and inviting. Hannah was seated in the fifth row, hallway side, even though she had wanted a window seat. High school life soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted.",

Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use. Of course, the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge. In the middle of the 19th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were. He answered, \"Madam, what good is a baby?\" Of course, Faraday's experiments were the beginning of the electronic age. Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world ― transistors, vaccines, plastics ― began as basic research. Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems. Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional. Science is the study of nature, and as we learn more about how nature works, we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us. The seemingly __________ knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature. Science tells us where we are and what we are, and that knowledge is beyond value.",

        "value": "We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research. Our exploration of worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and expense because it has no known practical use. Of course, the problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge will be of use until we acquire that knowledge. In the middle of the 19th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with electricity and magnetism were. He answered, \"Madam, what good is a baby?\" Of course, Faraday's experiments were the beginning of the electronic age. Many of the practical uses of scientific knowledge that fill our world ― transistors, vaccines, plastics ― began as basic research. Basic scientific research provides the raw materials that technology and engineering use to solve problems. Basic scientific research has yet one more important use that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely functional. Science is the study of nature, and as we learn more about how nature works, we learn more about what our existence in this universe means for us. The seemingly __________ knowledge we gain from space probes to other worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the scheme of nature. Science tells us where we are and what we are, and that knowledge is beyond value.",

Yet so often we confuse means with ends, and sacrifice happiness (end) for money (means). It is easy to do this when material wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end, as it so often is in our society. ( ① ) This is not to say that the accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself wrong. ( ② ) Material prosperity can help individuals, as well as society, attain higher levels of happiness. ( ③ ) Financial security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful and from having to worry about the next paycheck. ( ④ ) Moreover, the desire to make money can challenge and inspire us. ( ⑤ ) Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth. [Even so, it is not the money per se that is valuable, but the fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences.]",

By 1965 there were only around 80 birds left on Lake Atitlán. One immediate reason was easy enough to spot: the local human population was cutting down the reed beds at a furious rate. This (A) accommodation / destruction was driven by the needs of a fast growing mat-making industry. But there were other problems. An American airline was intent on developing the lake as a tourist destination for fishermen. However, there was a major problem with this idea: the lake (B) lacked / supported any suitable sporting fish! To compensate for this rather obvious defect, a specially selected species of fish called the Large-mouthed Bass was introduced. The introduced individuals immediately turned their attentions to the crabs and small fish that lived in the lake, thus (C) competing / cooperating with the few remaining grebes for food. There is also little doubt that they sometimes gobbled up the zebra-striped Atitlán Giant Grebe's chicks.",

He was born in Caunus, on the coast of Caria, but lived most of his life in Rhodes. Little else is known of him. But there are some accounts of his paintings. The Ialysus and the Satyr were the most well-known among his works. Protogenes spent approximately seven years painting the Ialysus, a depiction of a local hero of a town in Rhodes. After remaining in Rhodes for at least 200 years, it was carried off to Rome. There later it was destroyed by fire. Protogenes worked on the Satyr during Demetrius Poliorcetes' attack on Rhodes from 305 to 304 B.C. Interestingly, the garden in which he painted the Satyr was in the middle of the enemy's camp.

The percentage of parents who browsed shelves is the same as that of parents who borrowed print books.

    "questionText": "The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades have been documented with students from different cultures. Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning, we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather than extrinsic. Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward. Since there are three decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse students.",

Being assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable. Being a counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent when someone tells a racist joke. An assertive counselor would find a way to call that person's attention to the fact that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer, and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided.

So I didn't hesitate to sign up and pay the non-refundable deposit for the second week program, which is from July 13 to 17. But today I remembered that our family is going to get back from a trip on July 13, and I'm afraid Bradley won't be able to make it on the very first day of the program. Rather than make him skip the day, I'd like to check to see if he could switch to the third week program. Please let us know if that's possible. Thank you.\nSincerely,\nChristina Markle",

It reads, \"Dear Dr. Brown, thanks for teaching Mr. Wills to teach Tisha and Kelly.\" Mr. Wills is Jeremy Wills, and (a) he is one of my former students. A few years back, he took my positive psychology class in college.\n(B)\nBefore long, the reality hit Jeremy hard. Even after spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans, it became clear that his methods were not working. One of the worst moments was when (b) he distributed a math test. Many students didn't even look at the exam. They just put their heads on their desks and slept. Jeremy became so stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom.\n(C)\nAfter graduation, Jeremy joined an organization that recruits future leaders to teach in low-income communities. (c) He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county in North Carolina. Later, his assistant principal took note of Jeremy's high expectations and asked him to take over (d) his math class. He took charge of about a dozen failing \"special ed\" kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them. His idealism ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix all of their problems.\n(D)\nJeremy knew something had to change. (e) He then thought back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed. That's when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes within the classroom. He borrowed lessons from my positive psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students. As the students' attitudes became more optimistic, their confidence with math grew too. At the end of the school year, 80 percent of Jeremy's students passed the state's math test.",

    "questionText": "Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more productive than smaller groups (two or three members). Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems. Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions.\nThere is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members. The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members ― one side always has a numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the number five has special significance. Groups of this size usually ________ the problems we have just outlined. Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three.

        "value": "Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more productive than smaller groups (two or three members). Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems. Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions.\nThere is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members. The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members ― one side always has a numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the number five has special significance. Groups of this size usually ________ the problems we have just outlined. Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.",

( ① ) For their experiments they took 15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental enclosure. ( ② ) These nymphs should have taken a further two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one year. ( ③ ) By doing this, the trees were \"tricked\" into flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once. ( ④ ) Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. ( ⑤ ) So it seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the peaks.",

In retrospect, they probably made a poor choice, for the expression \"multitasking\" is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It was a clever turn of phrase that's misleading, for even computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When they \"multitask,\" they switch back and forth, alternating their attention until both tasks are done.

When a principle is part of a person's moral code, that person is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that principle.

    "questionText": "It is well known that some baseball parks are better for hitting home runs than others. It is not just the size of the park that matters. Other park conditions such as wind and humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences, and players know this. So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one ― say, 28 percent better? One analysis found that the player hit 60 percent more home runs. Why? The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is. If you think you are likely to hit more home runs, you are more likely to swing for the fences. But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller, your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base.\nIn business and life, just as in baseball, our ________ can affect whether we swing for the fences or not. The baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that distance to be. Consider your work and your current life. Do the fences seem too far away to hit a home run? Simply adjust the fences so that it seems easier.",

The traffic was heavy, and it was likely the blind man would get hit, as he was not crossing at a crosswalk. Tom looked around and saw there was no one else to help, so he asked the blind man if he would like help crossing the street. The blind man readily said yes, then latched onto Tom's arm, and they began their walk across the street avoiding speeding cars. When Tom looked back at the bus stop bench, he saw another man sitting next to his book bag. And when Tom got to the bus stop bench, the man said, \"I saw what you were doing, so I decided to sit here and watch your book bag.\"",
