    "questionText": "(A)\n\"Do you remember when Sean used to tell me that I was the best dad in the world?\" Ethan asked his wife, Grace. \"Yes, I do. I always envied your relationship with Sean,\" she replied. Ethan then shared how things had changed since (a) his son started middle school. Grace had noticed Ethan often pushing Sean to study harder. \"Maybe he isn't that into school right now. How about going hiking, just the two of you?\" she suggested. He agreed, and realizing that both his and Sean's hiking jackets were still at the laundry, he asked his wife to go and pick them up with him.\n\n(B)\nEthan and Grace came back home with the jackets and checked if Sean had everything else he needed for hiking. Luckily, in his drawers they found his hat, shoes, sunglasses, and hiking sticks. When Sean returned from school, Ethan softly said, \"Sean, let's go hiking this Saturday, just the two of us.\" Though Sean thanked (b) him for the suggestion, he said he had to go to the library. Grace stepped in, \"You know, the weather this weekend will be the best of the year. Why not enjoy it?\" After a moment's hesitation, (c) he agreed.\n\n(C)\n\"When did you bring the jackets in?\" the clerk at the laundry asked. \"Maybe two weeks ago,\" Ethan replied. Then, Grace quickly reminded (d) him, \"Honey, we actually left them here a month ago.\" The clerk went into the storage area to look for the clothes. Finally, he returned with the jackets and handed them to Ethan. The clerk politely said, \"I am sorry, but please collect your items earlier next time. Our storage is too full.\" Ethan felt embarrassed for the late collection and apologized.\n\n(D)\nThe weather was perfect. Ethan and Sean set off hiking along the valley by Aicken Mountain. They walked in silence until Sean fell over a rock and twisted his ankle. Realizing he couldn't walk, Ethan carried his son down on his back. He felt Sean's heartbeat, something he hadn't felt since Sean was a baby. Suddenly, Sean said, \"Dad, I'm sorry. At some point, I started to become afraid of disappointing (e) you. But you are still the best dad.\" Energized, he felt no weight on his back and replied, \"You are the best son, no matter what.\"",

I always envied your relationship with Sean,\" she replied. Ethan then shared how things had changed since (a) his son started middle school. Grace had noticed Ethan often pushing Sean to study harder. \"Maybe he isn't that into school right now. How about going hiking, just the two of you?\" she suggested. He agreed, and realizing that both his and Sean's hiking jackets were still at the laundry, he asked his wife to go and pick them up with him.\n\n(B)\nEthan and Grace came back home with the jackets and checked if Sean had everything else he needed for hiking. Luckily, in his drawers they found his hat, shoes, sunglasses, and hiking sticks. When Sean returned from school, Ethan softly said, \"Sean, let's go hiking this Saturday, just the two of us.\" Though Sean thanked (b) him for the suggestion, he said he had to go to the library. Grace stepped in, \"You know, the weather this weekend will be the best of the year. Why not enjoy it?\" After a moment's hesitation, (c) he agreed.\n\n(C)\n\"When did you bring the jackets in?\" the clerk at the laundry asked. \"Maybe two weeks ago,\" Ethan replied. Then, Grace quickly reminded (d) him, \"Honey, we actually left them here a month ago.\" The clerk went into the storage area to look for the clothes. Finally, he returned with the jackets and handed them to Ethan. The clerk politely said, \"I am sorry, but please collect your items earlier next time. Our storage is too full.\" Ethan felt embarrassed for the late collection and apologized.\n\n(D)\nThe weather was perfect. Ethan and Sean set off hiking along the valley by Aicken Mountain. They walked in silence until Sean fell over a rock and twisted his ankle. Realizing he couldn't walk, Ethan carried his son down on his back. He felt Sean's heartbeat, something he hadn't felt since Sean was a baby. Suddenly, Sean said, \"Dad, I'm sorry. At some point, I started to become afraid of disappointing (e) you. But you are still the best dad.\" Energized, he felt no weight on his back and replied, \"You are the best son, no matter what.\"",

Typically, synthetic ingredients can be made in a precisely controlled fashion and have well-defined compositions and properties, allowing careful evaluation of their potential toxicity. On the other hand, natural ingredients often vary appreciably in their composition and properties depending on their origin, the time of year they were harvested, the climate they experienced throughout their lifetime, the soil quality, and how they were isolated and stored. These variations can make testing their safety extremely difficult ― one is never sure about the potential toxicity of minor components that may vary from time to time. In some cases, a natural food component has been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years without causing any obvious health problems and can, therefore, be assumed to be safe. However, one must still be very careful.\n\n[The ______________ of the production process for synthetic food ingredients and the variability of natural food ingredients may ______________ people's commonly held assumption that the natural ingredients are more secure.]",
