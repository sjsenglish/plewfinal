- Identifies academic terminology and concepts
- Recognizes interdisciplinary connections
- Detects personal growth indicators

### Sample High-Value Insight Extraction

**Input:** "Reading Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century made me realize how r > g isn't just an economic formula - it's a framework for understanding social inequality. This connects to what I learned in history about wealth concentration during the Gilded Age, and I can see applications in modern policy debates about inheritance tax."

**Extracted Insights:**

1. **Conceptual Insight** (Score: 8.7/10)
   - Concept: "r > g formula as inequality framework"
   - Learning: "Economic models can explain social phenomena beyond pure economics"
   - Academic Level: 9/10 (university-level economic theory)
   - University Relevance: 9/10 (highly relevant to Economics/PPE)

2. **Connection Insight** (Score: 8.2/10) 
   - Primary Concept: "Piketty's inequality theory"
   - Secondary Concept: "Gilded Age wealth patterns"
   - Connection: "Mathematical models explaining historical social patterns"
   - Interdisciplinary: Yes (Economics + History)

3. **Application Insight** (Score: 7.8/10)
   - Concept: "r > g framework"
   - Application: "Modern inheritance tax policy analysis"
   - Practical Relevance: 8/10
   - Policy implications recognized
