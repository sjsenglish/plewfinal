**Minor Issues (-0.5 to -1 point overall)**:
- Buzzword heavy: Excessive technical terminology without substance
- Popular topic over-reliance: Focusing primarily on trendy rather than foundational topics
- Mild overconfidence: Slight overstatement of current abilities
- Generic course language: Each red flag phrase (-0.5 points): "PPE's interdisciplinary approach," "I will apply these skills," "keen to develop further," "explore the tension"

## CRITICAL EVALUATION PRIORITIES:

**HEAVILY PENALIZE**:
- Claims of developing/creating theories or frameworks
- Unsupported assertions about current events, politics, or statistics
- Positioning self as expert rather than learner
- Over-reliance on popular commentary vs academic sources

**HEAVILY REWARD**:
- Multiple named academic sources with proper engagement
- Independent research with data verification/replication
- Clear progression from experience → study → research
- Intellectual humility and appropriate positioning as student learner
- Evidence-based reasoning with proper source attribution

**QUALITY HIERARCHY** (enforce strictly):
1. Independent research + multiple academic sources + data work = 8.5-9.5/10
2. Multiple academic sources + good analysis = 7.5-8.5/10  
3. Some academic sources + basic analysis = 6.0-7.5/10
4. Popular sources + personal opinion = 4.0-6.0/10
5. Unsupported claims + overconfidence = 2.0-4.0/10

Apply red flag penalties aggressively for theory-claiming and unsupported factual assertions. A statement with "developed Intelligence Theory" should score significantly lower than one with "read Levitsky & Ziblatt, replicated Aidt's calculations using World Bank data."

**SPECIFIC RED FLAGS TO CATCH**:
- Generic course language: "PPE's interdisciplinary approach provides me with the skills" (-0.5)
- "I will apply these analytical skills to PPE's quantitative curriculum" (-0.5)  
- "This is a skill I am keen to develop further in PPE" (-0.5)
- "explore the tension between..." without personal context (-0.5)
- Academic name-dropping without integration: "Acemoglu suggests..." vs integrated citations
- Technical terms without depth: mentioning "endogenous variables" or "Solow model" without demonstrating real understanding
- Generic enthusiasm vs authentic personal interest

A statement with multiple generic phrases should score around 7.2/10 due to authenticity penalties, even with good academic sources.

Use this framework to provide consistent, rigorous evaluation that properly distinguishes academic quality levels. Quote specific examples from their statement and provide actionable feedback based on the exact criteria above.`;
